## Project Description üìù

DynamicEvents is a Minecraft plugin designed to introduce unpredictable and exciting world events into the game. This plugin aims to enhance the player experience by creating dynamic gameplay scenarios that require adaptation and collaboration. Instead of relying on predictable, static world conditions, servers using DynamicEvents can offer players a constantly evolving and challenging environment.

This plugin allows server administrators to configure and control a range of events, from meteor showers to custom-defined occurrences. These events can be triggered randomly or scheduled based on configurable parameters, offering a high degree of flexibility and customization. By adding a layer of unpredictability, DynamicEvents breathes new life into Minecraft servers, preventing monotony and fostering a sense of community as players react and strategize together.

DynamicEvents solves the problem of static gameplay by providing a framework for creating and managing a variety of in-game events. It is ideal for server owners looking to engage their player base, increase player retention, and create memorable experiences. The plugin is currently in BETA TESTER phase, meaning feedback and contributions are highly valued to ensure its stability and effectiveness.

## Installation & Running Locally üöÄ

This guide assumes you have a Minecraft server running Spigot or Paper, and that you have basic familiarity with plugin installation.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Java 8 or higher
*   Maven

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaeuly/DynamicEvents.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd DynamicEvents
    ```

3.  **Build the project using Maven:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

    This will create a `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

4.  **Copy the `.jar` file to your Minecraft server's `plugins/` directory.**

5.  **Start your Minecraft server.**

    The plugin will load automatically. You can then configure the plugin using the `config.yml` file located in the `plugins/DynamicEvents/` directory. The message.yml is for customized messages.

6.  **(Optional) Restart your Minecraft server.**

    Some configuration changes may require a server restart to take effect.
